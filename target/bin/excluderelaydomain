${ORANGE}DESCRIPTION${RESET}
    When a default relay-host is configured (via ENV), the default behaviour
    is to relay all your mail accounts outgoing mail through that service.

    This command allows to opt-out from that default behaviour by excluding
    all mail accounts belonging to a hosted domain you specify.

${ORANGE}EXAMPLES${RESET}
    ${LWHITE}./setup.sh relay exclude-domain example.com${RESET}
        Any mail submitted from your '@example.com' accounts will be sent
        without relaying through a default relay-host (if one was configured).

${ORANGE}EXIT STATUS${RESET}
    Exit status is 0 if command was successful. If wrong arguments are provided
    or arguments contain errors, the script will exit early with exit status 1.
