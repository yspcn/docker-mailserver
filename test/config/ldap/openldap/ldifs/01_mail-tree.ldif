# The root object of the tree, all entries will branch off this one:
dn: dc=example,dc=test
# DN is formed from `example.test` DNS labels:
# NOTE: This is just a common convention (not dependent on hostname or any external config)
objectClass: dcObject
# Must reference left most component:
dc: example
# It's required to use an `objectClass` that implements a "Structural Class":
objectClass: organization
# Value is purely descriptive, not important to tests:
o: DMS Test

# User accounts will belong to this subtree:
dn: ou=users,dc=example,dc=test
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: users
