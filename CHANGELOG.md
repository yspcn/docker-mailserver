### Deprecation Notice

- **Removing TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 ciphersuites from `TLS_LEVEL=intermediate`**
  You should not realistically need support for TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1, except in niche scenarios such as an old printer/scanner device that refuses to negotiate a compatible non-vulnerable cipher. [More details covered here](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/issues/2679).
- **`SASL_PASSWD` ENV**
  An old ENV `SASL_PASSWD` has been around for supporting relay-host authentication, but since superceded by the `postfix-sasl-password.cf` config file. It will be removed in a future major release as detailed [here](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2605).
- **Platform Support - ARMv7**
  This is a very old platform, superceded by ARMv8 and newer with broad product availability around 2016 onwards.
  Support was introduced primarily for users of the older generations of Raspberry Pi. ARM64 is the modern target for ARM devices.

  If you require ARMv7 support, [please let us know](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/issues/2642).

## [11.2.0](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/releases/tag/v11.2.0)

### Summary

This release features a lot of small and medium-sized changes, many related to how the image is build and tested during CI.

> **Note**: This part of the changelog was created before switching to the "Keep a Changelog"-format.

## `v11.1.0`

In this release the relay-host support saw [significant internal refactoring](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2604) in preparation for a future breaking change. Similar extensive restructuring through the codebase also occurred, where [each PR provides more details](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/milestone/17?closed=1). Care was taken to avoid breakage, but there may be some risk affecting unsupported third-party customizations which our test suite is unaware of.

### Features

- There is now support for [Dovecot-Master accounts](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/v11.1/config/advanced/dovecot-master-accounts/) that provide admin access to all mail accounts ([#2535](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2535))

### Fixes

- Using Port 465 to authenticate with a relay-host no longer breaks the Amavis transport for Postfix ([#2607](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2607))
- When mounting `/var/mail-state`, disabled services will no longer copy over data redundantly ([#2608](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2608))
- Amavis is now aware of new domains detected during Change Detection, no longer skipping virus and spam filtering ([#2616](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2616))
- `setup.sh -c <container name>` no longer ignores `<container name>` when more than 1 `docker-mailserver` container is running ([#2622](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2622))

### Improvements

- The Change Detector service will now only process relevant changes ([#2615](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2615)), in addition to now monitoring `postfix-sasl-password.cf`, `postfix-relaymap.cf`, and `postfix-regexp.cf` ([#2623](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2623))
- For LDAP users that only need to support a single mail domain, `setup config dkim` should now detect the domain implicitly ([#2620](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2620))
- The container capability `SYS_PTRACE` is no longer necessary ([#2624](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2624))
- Added an example for configuring a basic container `healthcheck` command ([#2625](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2625))
- Postfix `main.cf` setting `compatibility_level` was set to `2` during our startup scripts. This is now part of our default shipped `main.cf` config ([#2597](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2597))
- The Postfix `main.cf` override/extension support via `postfix-main.cf` has been improved to support multi-line values, instead of the previous single-line only support ([#2598](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2598))

### Deprecation Notice

- **`SASL_PASSWD` ENV**
  An old ENV `SASL_PASSWD` has been around for supporting relay-host authentication, but since superceded by the `postfix-sasl-password.cf` config file. It will be removed in a future major release as detailed [here](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2605).
- **Platform Support - ARMv7**
  This is a very old platform, superceded by ARMv8 and newer with broad product availability around 2016 onwards.
  Support was introduced primarily for users the older generations of Raspberry Pi. ARM64 is the modern target for ARM devices.

  If you require ARMv7 support, [please let us know](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/issues/2642).

## `v11.0.0`

### Major Changes

1. [**Internal logging has been refactored**](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2493). The environment variable `DMS_DEBUG` has been replaced by [`LOG_LEVEL`](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/v11.0/config/environment/#log_level) to better control the verbosity of logs we output. The new logger is more structured and follows standard log conventions. `LOG_LEVEL` can be set to: `error`, `warn`, `info` (default), `debug` and `trace`.
2. [**`iptables` has been replaced by `nftables`**](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2505). The Fail2Ban configuration was adjusted accordingly. If you use `iptables` yourself (e.g. in `user-patches.sh`), make sure to update the scripts.
3. **[`PERMIT_DOCKER`](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/v11.0/config/environment/#permit_docker) has a new default value of `none`**. This change [better secures Podman](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2424); to keep the old behaviour (_adding the container IP address to Postfix's `mynetworks`_), use `PERMIT_DOCKER=container`.

### Minor Changes

1. **Many** minor improvements were made (cleanup & refactoring). Please refer to the section below to get an overview over all improvements. Moreover, there was a lot of cleanup in the scripts and in the tests. The documentation was adjusted accordingly.
2. New environment variables were added:
   1. [`CLAMAV_MESSAGE_SIZE_LIMIT`](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/v11.0/config/environment/#clamav_message_size_limit)
   2. [`TZ`](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/v11.0/config/environment/#tz)
3. SpamAssassin KAM was added with [`ENABLE_SPAMASSASSIN_KAM`](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/v11.0/config/environment/#enable_spamassassin_kam).
4. The `fail2ban` command was reworked and can now ban IP addresses as well.
5. There were a few small fixes, especially when it comes to bugs in scripts and service restart loops (no functionality changes, only fixes of existing functionality). When building an image from the Dockerfile - Installation of Postfix on modern Linux distributions should now always succeed.
6. Some default values for environment values changed: these are mostly non-critical, please refer to [#2428](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2428) and [#2487](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2487).

## `v10.4.0`

This release upgrades our base image from Debian 10 to Debian 11.
There is also an important regression fixed for `SSL_TYPE=letsencrypt` users.

- **[fix]** A regression with `check-for-changes.sh` introduced in `v10.3.0` affected `SSL_TYPE=letsencrypt`, preventing detection of cert renewals to restart services (_unless using `acme.json`_) [#2326](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2326)
- **[improvement]** Base image upgraded from Debian 10 Buster to Debian 11 Bullseye [#2116](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2116)
  - Postfix upgraded from `3.4` to `3.5`. Dovecot upgraded from `2.3.4` to `2.3.13`. Python 2 is no longer included in the image, Python 3 remains (_[more information](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2116#issuecomment-955615529)_).
  - `yescrypt` is now supported upstream as a password hash algorithm, `docker-mailserver` continues to use `SHA512-CRYPT` (_[more information](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2116#issuecomment-955800544)_).
- **[chore]** Dovecot statistics service disabled [#2292](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2292)

## `v10.3.0`

**WARNING:** This release had a small regression affecting the detection of changes for certificates provisioned in `/etc/letsencrypt` with the config ENV `SSL_TYPE=letsencrypt`, unless you use Traefik's `acme.json`. If you rely on this functionality to restart Postfix and Dovecot when updating your cert files, this will not work and it is advised to upgrade to `v10.4.0` or newer prior to renewal of your certificates.

- **[fix]** The Dovecot `userdb` will now additionally create "dummy" accounts for basic alias maps (_alias maps to a single real account managed by Dovecot, relaying to external providers aren't affected_) when `ENABLE_QUOTAS=1` (default) as a workaround for Postfix `quota-status` plugin querying Dovecot with inbound mail for a user, which Postfix uses to reject mail if quota has been exceeded (_to avoid risk of blacklisting from spammers abusing backscatter_) [#2248](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2248)
  - **NOTE:** If using aliases that map to another alias or multiple addresses, _this remains a risk_.
- **[fix]** `setup email list` command will no longer attempt to query Dovecot quota status when `ENABLE_QUOTAS` is disabled [#2264](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2264)
- **[fix]** `SSL_DOMAIN` ENV should now work much more reliably [#2274](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2274), [#2278](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2278), [#2279](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2279)
- **[fix]** DKIM - Removed `refile:` (_regex type_) from KeyTable entry in `opendkim.conf`, fixes validation error output from `opendkim-testkey` [#2249](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2249)
- **[fix]** DMARC - Removed quotes around the hostname value in `opendmarc.conf`. This avoids an authentication failure where an OpenDKIM header was previously ignored [#2291](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2291)
- **[fix]** When using `ONE_DIR=1` (default), the `spool-postfix` folder now has the correct permissions carried over. This resolves some failures notably with sieve filters [#2273](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2273)
- **[improvement]** Warnings are now logged for ClamAV and SpamAssassin if they are enabled but Amavis is disabled (_which is required for them to work correctly_) [#2251](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2251)
- **[improvement]** `user-patches.sh` is now invoked via `bash` to assist Kubernetes deployments with `ConfigMap` [#2295](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2295)

### Internal

These changes are primarily internal and are only likely relevant to users that maintain their own modifications related to the changed files.

- **[chore]** Redundant config from Postfix `master.cf` has been removed, it should not affect any users as our images have not included any of the related processes [#2272](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2272)
- **[refactor]** `check-for-changes.sh` was carrying some duplicate code from `setup-stack.sh` that was falling out of sync, they now share common code [#2260](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2260)
- **[refactor]** `acme.json` extraction was refactored into a CLI utility and updated to Python 3 (_required for future upgrade to Debian 11 Bullseye base image_) [#2274](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2274)
- **[refactor]** As part of the Traefik `acme.json` and `SSL_DOMAIN` work, logic for `SSL_TYPE=letsencrypt` was also revised [#2278](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2278)
- **[improvement]** Some minor tweaks to how we derive the internal `HOSTNAME` and `DOMAINNAME` from user configured `hostname` and `domainname` settings [#2280](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2280)

## `v10.2.0`

- You no longer need to maintain a copy of `setup.sh` matching your version release from v10.2 of `docker-mailserver` onwards. Version specific functionality of `setup.sh` has moved into the container itself, while `setup.sh` remains as a convenient wrapper to: `docker exec -it <container name> setup <command>`.
- [`ONE_DIR`](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/v10.2/config/environment/#one_dir) now defaults to enabled (`1`).
- For anyone relying on internal location of certificates (_internal copy of mounted files at startup_), the Postfix and Dovecot location of `/etc/postfix/ssl` has changed to `/etc/dms/tls`. This may affect any third-party `user-patches.sh` scripts that depended on this path to update certs.
- The [_Let's Encrypt_ section of our SSL / TLS docs](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/v10.2/config/security/ssl#lets-encrypt-recommended) has been brought up to date.

### Bigger scripts-related improvements

- **[scripts]** update `setup.sh` to now use a running container first if one exists [#2134](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2134)
- **[scripts]** included `setup.sh` functionality inside the container to be version independent again [#2174](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2174)
- **[scripts]** `HOSTNAME` and `DOMAINNAME` setup improved [#2175](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2175)
- **[scripts]** `delmailuser` can now delete mailboxed without TLD [#2172](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2172)
- **[scripts]** properly exit on failure ([#2199](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2199) in conjunction with [#2196](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2196))
- **[scripts]** make `setup.sh` completely non-interactive for Podman users [#2201](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2201)

### Security

Some internal refactoring and fixes happened this release cycle in [#2196](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2196):

- **[improve]** The Postfix and Dovecot location of `/etc/postfix/ssl` has changed to `/etc/dms/tls`
- **[improve]** An invalid `SSL_TYPE` or a valid value with an invalid configuration will now panic, exiting the container and emitting a fatal error to the logs
- **[fix]** An unconfigured/empty `SSL_TYPE` ENV now correctly disables SSL support for Dovecot and general Postfix configurations. A reminder that this is unsupported officially, and is only intended for tests and troubleshooting. Use only [a valid `SSL_TYPE`](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/v10.2/config/environment/#ssl_type) (_`letsencrypt` and `manual` are recommended_) for production deployments
- **[fix]** `TLS_LEVEL=intermediate` now modifies the system (container) `openssl.cnf` config to set the minimum protocol to TLS 1.0 (_from 1.2_) and cipher-suite support to `DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=1` (_from `2`_). This change is required for Dovecot in upcoming Debian Bullseye upgrade, to be compatible with the `TLS_LEVEL=intermediate` cipher-suite profile. It may affect other software within the container that relies on this openssl config, should you extend the Docker image [#2193](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2193)
- **[fix]** Provide DH parameters (_default: RFC 7919 group `ffdhe406.pem`_) at build-time, instead of during startup. Custom DH parameters regardless of `ONE_DIR` are now only detected when mounted to `/tmp/docker-mailserver/dhparams.pem` [#2192](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2192)
- **[docs]** Revise the _Let's Encrypt_ section of our SSL / TLS docs [#2209](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2209)

### Miscellaneous small additions and changes

- **[ci]** improved caching [#2197](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2197)
- **[ci]** refactored spam tests and introduced common container setup template [#2198](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2198)
- **[fix]** update Fail2Ban wrapper to propagate errors to user [#2170](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2170)
- **[fix]** Dockerfile `sed`'s are now checked [#2158](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2158)
- **[general]** Updated default value of `ONE_DIR` to `1` [#2148](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2148)
- **[docs]** updated Kubernetes documentation [#2111](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2111)
- **[docs]** introduced dedicated Podman documentation [#2179](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2179)
- **[docs]** miscellaneous documentation improvements
- **[misc]** introduced GitHub issue forms for issue templates [#2160](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2160)
- **[misc]** Removed the internal `mkcert.sh` script for Dovecot as it is no longer needed [#2196](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2196)

## `v10.0.0`

This release improves on `9.1.0` in many aspect, including general fixes, Fail2Ban, LDAP and documentation. This release contains breaking changes.

- **[general]** Fixed many prose errors (spelling, grammar, indentation).
- **[general]** Documentation is better integrated into the development process and it's visibility within the project increased ([#1878](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1878)).
- **[general]** Added `stop_grace_period:` to example Compose file and supervisord ([#1896](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1896) [#1945](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1945))
- **[general]** `./setup.sh email list` was enhanced, now showing information neatly ([#1898](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1898))
- **[general]** Added update check and notification ([#1976](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1976), [#1951](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1951))
- **[general]** Moved environment variables to the documentation and improvements ([#1948](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1948), [#1947](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1947), [#1931](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1931))
- **[security]** Major Fail2Ban improvements (cleanup, update and breaking changes, see below)
- **[fix]** `./setup.sh email del ...` now works properly
- **[code]** Added color variables to `setup.sh` and improved the script as a whole ([#1879](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1879), [#1886](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1886))
- **[ldap]** Added `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_SENDERS` ([#1902](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1902))
- **[ldap]** Use dovecots LDAP `uris` connect option instead of `hosts` ([#1901](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1901))

- **[docs]** PRs that contain changes to docs will now be commented with a preview link ([#1988](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1988))

### Breaking Changes

- **[security]** Fail2Ban adjustments:
  - Fail2ban v0.11.2 is now used ([#1965](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1965)).
  - The previous F2B config (from an old Debian release) has been replaced with the latest default config for F2B shipped by Debian 10.
  - The new default blocktype is now `DROP`, not `REJECT` ([#1914](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1914)).
  - A ban now applies to all ports (`iptables-allports`), not just the ones that were "attacked" ([#1914](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1914)).
  - Fail2ban 0.11 is totally compatible to 0.10, but the database got some new tables and fields (auto-converted during the first start), so once updated to DMS 10.0.0, you have to remove the database `mailstate:/lib-fail2ban/fail2ban.sqlite3` if you would need to downgrade to DMS 9.1.0 for some reason.
- **[ldap]** Removed `SASLAUTHD_LDAP_SSL`. Instead provide a protocol in `SASLAUTHD_LDAP_SERVER` and adjust `SASLAUTHD_LDAP_` default values ([#1989](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1989)).
- **[general]** Removed `stable` release tag ([#1975](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1975)):
  - Scheduled builds are now based off `edge`.
  - Instead of `stable`, please use the latest version tag available (_or the `latest` tag_).
  - The `stable` image tag will be removed from DockerHub in the near future.
- **[setup]** Removed `./setup config ssl` command (_deprecated since v9_). `SSL_TYPE=self-signed` remains supported however. ([`dc8f49de`](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/commit/dc8f49de548e2c2e2aa321841585153a99cd3858), [#2021](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2021))

## `v9.1.0`

This release marks the breakpoint where the wiki was transferred to a [reworked documentation](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/edge/)

- **[feat]** Introduce ENABLE_AMAVIS env ([#1866](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1866))
- **[docs]** Move wiki to gh-pages ([#1826](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1826)) - Special thanks to @polarathene 👨🏻‍💻
  - You can [edit the docs](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/tree/master/docs/content) now directly with your code changes
  - Documentation is now versioned related to docker image versions and viewable here: <https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/edge/>

## `v9.0.1`

A small update on the notification function which was made more stable as well as minor fixes.

- **[fix]** `_notify` cannot fail anymore - non-zero returns lead to unintended behavior in the past when `DMS_DEBUG` was not set or `0`
- **[refactor]** `check-for-changes.sh` now uses `_notify`

## `v9.0.0`

- **[feat]** Support extra `user_attributes` in accounts configuration ([#1792](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1792))
- **[feat]** Add possibility to use a custom dkim selector ([#1811](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1811))
- **[feat]** TLS: Dual (aka hybrid) certificate support! (eg ECDSA certificate with an RSA fallback for broader compatibility) ([#1801](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1801)).
  - This feature is presently only for `SSL_TYPE=manual`, all you need to do is provide your fallback certificate to the `SSL_ALT_CERT_PATH` and `SSL_ALT_KEY_PATH` ENV vars, just like your primary certificate would be setup for manual mode.
- **[security]** TLS: You can now use ECDSA certificates! ([#1802](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1802))
  - Warning: ECDSA may not be supported by legacy systems (most pre-2014). You can provide an RSA certificate as a fallback.
- **[fix]** TLS: For some docker-compose setups when restarting the docker-mailserver container, internal config state may have been persisted despite making changes that should reconfigure TLS (eg changing `SSL_TYPE` or replacing the certificate file) ([#1801](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1801)).
- **[refactor]** Split `start-mailserver.sh` ([#1820](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1820))
- **[fix]** Linting now uses local path to remove the sudo dependency ([#1831](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1831)).

### Breaking Changes

- **[security]** TLS: `TLS_LEVEL=modern` has changed the server-side preference order to 128-bit before 256-bit encryption ([#1802](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1802)).
  - NOTE: This is still very secure but may result in misleading lower scores/grades from security audit websites.
- **[security]** TLS: `TLS_LEVEL=modern` removed support for AES-CBC cipher suites and follows best practices by supporting only AEAD cipher suites ([#1802](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1802)).
  - NOTE: As TLS 1.2 is the minimum required for modern already, AEAD cipher suites should already be supported and preferred.
- **[security]** TLS: `TLS_LEVEL=intermediate` has removed support for cipher suites using RSA for key exchange (only available with an RSA certificate) ([#1802](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1802)).
  - NOTE: This only affects Dovecot which supported 5 extra cipher suites using AES-CBC and AES-GCM. Your users MUA clients should be unaffected, preferring ECDHE or DHE for key exchange.
- **[refactor]** Complete refactoring of opendkim script ([#1812](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1812)).
  - NOTE: Use `./setup.sh config dkim help` to see the new syntax.

## `v8.0.1`

This release is a hotfix for #1781.

- **[spam]** `bl.spamcop.net` was removed from the list of spam lists since the domain expired and became unusable

## `v8.0.0`
