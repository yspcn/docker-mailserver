title: Environment Variables
---

!!! info

    Values in **bold** are the default values. If an option doesn't work as documented here, check if you are running the latest image. The current `master` branch corresponds to the image `mailserver/docker-mailserver:edge`.

#### General

##### OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME

- **empty** => uses the `hostname` command to get canonical hostname for `docker-mailserver` to use.
- => Specify a fully-qualified domainname to serve mail for. This is used for many of the config features so if you can't set your hostname (_eg: you're in a container platform that doesn't let you_) specify it via this environment variable. It will take priority over `docker run` options: `--hostname` and `--domainname`, or `docker-compose.yml` config equivalents: `hostname:` and `domainname:`.

##### DMS_DEBUG

**This environment variable was removed in `v11.0.0`!** Use `LOG_LEVEL` instead.

##### LOG_LEVEL

Set the log level for DMS. This is mostly relevant for container startup scripts and change detection event feedback.

Valid values (in order of increasing verbosity) are: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` and `trace`. The default log level is `info`.

##### SUPERVISOR_LOGLEVEL

Here you can adjust the [log-level for Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/logging.html#activity-log-levels). Possible values are

- critical => Only show critical messages
- error    => Only show erroneous output
- **warn** => Show warnings
- info     => Normal informational output
- debug    => Also show debug messages

The log-level will show everything in its class and above.

##### ONE_DIR

- 0 => state in default directories.
- **1** => consolidate all states into a single directory (`/var/mail-state`) to allow persistence using docker volumes. See the [related FAQ entry][docs-faq-onedir] for more information.

##### ACCOUNT_PROVISIONER

Configures the provisioning source of user accounts (including aliases) for user queries and authentication by services managed by DMS (_Postfix and Dovecot_).

User provisioning via OIDC is planned for the future, see [this tracking issue](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/issues/2713).

- **empty** => use FILE
- LDAP => use LDAP authentication
- OIDC => use OIDC authentication (**not yet implemented**)
- FILE => use local files (this is used as the default)

A second container for the ldap service is necessary (e.g. [docker-openldap](https://github.com/osixia/docker-openldap))

##### PERMIT_DOCKER

Set different options for mynetworks option (can be overwrite in postfix-main.cf) **WARNING**: Adding the docker network's gateway to the list of trusted hosts, e.g. using the `network` or `connected-networks` option, can create an [**open relay**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_mail_relay), for instance if IPv6 is enabled on the host machine but not in Docker.

- **none** => Explicitly force authentication
- container => Container IP address only.
- host => Add docker host (ipv4 only).
- network => Add the docker default bridge network (172.16.0.0/12); **WARNING**: `docker-compose` might use others (e.g. 192.168.0.0/16) use `PERMIT_DOCKER=connected-networks` in this case.
- connected-networks => Add all connected docker networks (ipv4 only).

Note: you probably want to [set `POSTFIX_INET_PROTOCOLS=ipv4`](#postfix_inet_protocols) to make it work fine with Docker.

##### TZ

Set the timezone. If this variable is unset, the container runtime will try to detect the time using `/etc/localtime`, which you can alternatively mount into the container. The value of this variable must follow the pattern `AREA/ZONE`, i.e. of you want to use Germany's time zone, use `Europe/Berlin`. You can lookup all available timezones [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List).

##### ENABLE_RSPAMD

Enable or disable Rspamd.

!!! warning "Current State"

    Rspamd-support is under active development. Be aware that breaking changes can happen at any time.

    Currently, rspamd is integrated into Postfix as a milter. However, there is no official DKIM/DMARC support for rspamd in DMS as of now (WIP). To get more information, see [the detailed documentation page for Rspamd][docs-rspamd].

!!! warning "Rspamd and DNS Block Lists"

    When you use Rspamd, you might want to use the [RBL module](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/rbl.html). If you do, make sure your DNS resolver is set up correctly (i.e. it should be a non-public recursive resolver). Otherwise, you [might not be able](https://www.spamhaus.org/faq/section/DNSBL%20Usage#365) to make use of the block lists.

- **0** => disabled
- 1 => enabled

##### ENABLE_AMAVIS

Amavis content filter (used for ClamAV & SpamAssassin)

- 0     => Amavis is disabled
- **1** => Amavis is enabled

##### AMAVIS_LOGLEVEL

[This page](https://lists.amavis.org/pipermail/amavis-users/2011-March/000158.html) provides information on Amavis' logging statistics.

- -1/-2/-3 => Only show errors
- **0**    => Show warnings
- 1/2      => Show default informational output
- 3/4/5    => log debug information (very verbose)

##### ENABLE_DNSBL

This enables the [zen.spamhaus.org](https://www.spamhaus.org/zen/) DNS block list in postfix
and various [lists](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/blob/f7465a50888eef909dbfc01aff4202b9c7d8bc00/target/postfix/main.cf#L58-L66) in postscreen.

Note: Emails will be rejected, if they don't pass the block list checks!

- **0** => DNS block lists are disabled
- 1     => DNS block lists are enabled

##### ENABLE_OPENDKIM

Enables the OpenDKIM service.

- 1 => Enables POP3 service

##### ENABLE_CLAMAV

- **0** => ClamAV is disabled
- 1 => ClamAV is enabled

##### ENABLE_FAIL2BAN

- **0** => fail2ban service disabled
- 1 => Enables fail2ban service

If you enable Fail2Ban, don't forget to add the following lines to your `docker-compose.yml`:

``` BASH
cap_add:
  - NET_ADMIN
```

Otherwise, `nftables` won't be able to ban IPs.

##### FAIL2BAN_BLOCKTYPE

- **drop**   => drop packet (send NO reply)
- reject => reject packet (send ICMP unreachable)
FAIL2BAN_BLOCKTYPE=drop

##### SMTP_ONLY

- **empty** => all daemons start
- 1 => only launch postfix smtp

##### SSL_TYPE

In the majority of cases, you want `letsencrypt` or `manual`.

`self-signed` can be used for testing SSL until you provide a valid certificate, note that third-parties cannot trust `self-signed` certificates, do not use this type in production. `custom` is a temporary workaround that is not officially supported.

- **empty** => SSL disabled.
- letsencrypt => Support for using certificates with _Let's Encrypt_ provisioners. (Docs: [_Let's Encrypt_ Setup][docs-tls-letsencrypt])
- manual => Provide your own certificate via separate key and cert files. (Docs: [Bring Your Own Certificates][docs-tls-manual])
    - Requires: `SSL_CERT_PATH` and `SSL_KEY_PATH` ENV vars to be set to the location of the files within the container.
    - Optional: `SSL_ALT_CERT_PATH` and `SSL_ALT_KEY_PATH` allow providing a 2nd certificate as a fallback for dual (aka hybrid) certificate support. Useful for ECDSA with an RSA fallback. _Presently only `manual` mode supports this feature_.
- custom => Provide your own certificate as a single file containing both the private key and full certificate chain. (Docs: `None`)
- self-signed => Provide your own self-signed certificate files. Expects a self-signed CA cert for verification. **Use only for local testing of your setup**. (Docs: [Self-Signed Certificates][docs-tls-selfsigned])

Please read [the SSL page in the documentation][docs-tls] for more information.

##### TLS_LEVEL

- **empty** => modern
- modern => Enables TLSv1.2 and modern ciphers only. (default)
- intermediate => Enables TLSv1, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 and broad compatibility ciphers.

##### SPOOF_PROTECTION

##### ENABLE_SRS

Enables the Sender Rewriting Scheme. SRS is needed if `docker-mailserver` acts as forwarder. See [postsrsd](https://github.com/roehling/postsrsd/blob/master/README.md#sender-rewriting-scheme-crash-course) for further explanation.

- **0** => Disabled
- 1 => Enabled

##### NETWORK_INTERFACE

- `lmtp:unix:private/dovecot-lmtp` (use socket)
- `lmtps:inet:<host>:<port>` (secure lmtp with starttls)
- `lmtp:<kopano-host>:2003` (use kopano as mailstore)

##### POSTFIX\_MAILBOX\_SIZE\_LIMIT

Set the mailbox size limit for all users. If set to zero, the size will be unlimited (default).

- drop => Drop the connection immediately with a 521 SMTP reply. Repeat this test the next time the client connects.
- ignore => Ignore the failure of this test. Allow other tests to complete. Repeat this test the next time the client connects. This option is useful for testing and collecting statistics without blocking mail.

##### DOVECOT_MAILBOX_FORMAT

- **maildir** => uses very common Maildir format, one file contains one message
- sdbox => (experimental) uses Dovecot high-performance mailbox format, one file contains one message
- mdbox ==> (experimental) uses Dovecot high-performance mailbox format, multiple messages per file and multiple files per box

This option has been added in November 2019. Using other format than Maildir is considered as experimental in docker-mailserver and should only be used for testing purpose. For more details, please refer to [Dovecot Documentation](https://wiki2.dovecot.org/MailboxFormat).

If this is not set and reports are enabled with the old options, logrotate will be used.

##### PFLOGSUMM_RECIPIENT

Recipient address for Postfix log summary reports.

- **not set** => Use POSTMASTER_ADDRESS
- => Specify the recipient address(es)

##### PFLOGSUMM_SENDER

Sender address (`FROM`) for pflogsumm reports (if Postfix log summary reports are enabled).

- **not set** => Use REPORT_SENDER
- => Specify the sender address

##### LOGWATCH_INTERVAL

Interval for logwatch report.

- **none** => No report is generated
- daily => Send a daily report
- weekly => Send a report every week

##### LOGWATCH_RECIPIENT

Recipient address for logwatch reports if they are enabled.

- **not set** => Use REPORT_RECIPIENT or POSTMASTER_ADDRESS
- => Specify the recipient address(es)

##### LOGWATCH_SENDER

Sender address (`FROM`) for logwatch reports if logwatch reports are enabled.

##### LOGROTATE_INTERVAL

Changes the interval in which log files are rotated.

- **weekly** => Rotate log files weekly
- daily => Rotate log files daily
- monthly => Rotate log files monthly

!!! note

    `LOGROTATE_INTERVAL` only manages `logrotate` within the container for services we manage internally.

    The entire log output for the container is still available via `docker logs mailserver` (or your respective container name). If you want to configure external log rotation for that container output as well, : [Docker Logging Drivers](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/).

    By default, the logs are lost when the container is destroyed (eg: re-creating via `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`). To keep the logs, mount a volume (to `/var/log/mail/`).

!!! note

    This variable can also determine the interval for Postfix's log summary reports, see [`PFLOGSUMM_TRIGGER`](#pflogsumm_trigger).

    By default, `docker-mailserver` is configured to quarantine spam emails.

    If emails are quarantined, they are compressed and stored in a location dependent on the `ONE_DIR` setting above. To inhibit this behaviour and deliver spam emails, set this to a very high value e.g. `100.0`.

    If `ONE_DIR=1` (default) the location is `/var/mail-state/lib-amavis/virusmails/`, or if `ONE_DIR=0`: `/var/lib/amavis/virusmails/`. These paths are inside the docker container.
